# How we created a USB Stick with the exercises on it

## USB Make Remix with Pinguy

We followed [this article](http://pinguyos.com/2015/09/pinguy-builder-an-app-to-backupremix-buntu/) to make an ISO file containing an Ubuntu with Eclipse, IntelliJ, keyboard layouts and exercises.

It boils down to this:

* Have an Ubuntu installed
* Set up your environment with Eclipse, IntelliJ, keyboard layouts, git and the exercises
* Make sure you can run unit tests on both Eclipse and IntelliJ
* Also make sure the git credentials are gone (no lingering ssh keys etc.)
* git init on the exercises dir so our candidates can commit etc.
