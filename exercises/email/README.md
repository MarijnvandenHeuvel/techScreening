## Exercise 2 - Message Sending
Your job is to send a bunch of messages to a certain inbox based on the content of the original message.

Story 1: Forward all emails to the same target address
Story 2: Emails should be split in different categories:
Story 3: Log: For each email an trace should be logged. 
Story 4: Aggregated reporting: by the end of the day, how many emails where assigned to a certain category. This functionality should be consultable on demand.
